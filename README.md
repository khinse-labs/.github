# khinse-labs/.github

Default community health files and templates for every khinse-labs repository.

GitHub uses a file from here for any repository in the organisation that does not have its own file of that type. A repository's own file always wins.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) | Issue forms: bug, feature, chore and spike. Blank issues are off. |
| [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md) | Pull request template |
| [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) | How to contribute |
| [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) | Contributor Covenant 2.1 |
| [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) | How to report a vulnerability privately |
| [`SUPPORT.md`](SUPPORT.md) | Where to get help |
| [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md) | How decisions are made |

## Notes for maintainers

- If a repository has its own `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` folder, none of these issue forms are used there.
- The issue forms apply the labels `bug`, `enhancement`, `chore` and `spike`. Each label must exist in this repository and in every repository that uses the forms.
- Licences cannot be set here; add a `LICENSE` to each repository.
- This repository must stay public for the defaults to apply.
